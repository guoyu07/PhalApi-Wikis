##1.2.1 Tutorial
In this chapter, we wil explore how to enjoy developing an API in the shortest time.  
  
Here we go!
  
##1.2.2 Write an API
Let's start from "Hello World!". Put the follow code inside file ./Demo/Api/Welcome.php.  
```
<?php

class Api_Welcome extends PhalApi_Api {

	public function say() {
		$rs = array();
		$rs['title'] = 'Hello World!';
		return $rs;
	}
}
```

##1.2.3 Visit the API
The API service link looks like:  
```
http:// + host + entrance + ?service=XXX.XXX
```
Yeah out demo link is:
```
http://dev.phalapi.com/demo/?service=Welcome.Say
```

##1.2.4 Get the result
PhalApi will response with JSON, so here it is:
```
{"ret":200,"data":{"title":"Hello World!"},"msg":""}
```
  
To make the result more clear,
```
{
    "ret": 200,
    "data": {
        "title": "Hello World!"
    },
    "msg": ""
}
```
